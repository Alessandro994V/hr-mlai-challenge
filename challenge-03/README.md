# ML/AI Engineer - Challenge 03

Please provide the description of the procedure to analyze [provided land](https://public.17tons.tech/#/land/5) and define an algorithm that can be used to find the best location to deploy sensors for the most accurate monitoring possible in consideration of cost-effectiveness, land conditions and evolutions for the prevention of undesirable effects.

Raw data of land is available at [https://nft.17tons.tech/explorer/lands/5](https://nft.17tons.tech/explorer/lands/5) and tree positions are available at [https://nft.17tons.tech/explorer/trees/land/5](https://nft.17tons.tech/explorer/trees/land/5).

Providing a Jupyter Notebook with the procedure is a plus or even better the results with a working script.
